Deep color calibration for UAV imagery in crop monitoring

This project aims to build a general framework for color calibration in agricultural UAV remote sensing.

The dataset used in this study includes the UAV imagery of rice, bean, and cotton. The imagery were collected at different sites and different dates, where the ortho-mosaics present siginifcant color cast and color inconsistency. The dataset is available at https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/15TETGMJxQvuBOqjCTGQPu5OTCizF4pPK.

The source codes will be available soon.
